      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Nikhit — a self-taught Automotive concept designer who loves turning
        imagination into machines that look like they’re built for the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        I sketch cars the way some people doodle stick figures, and somehow it
        just… works. I design everything from raw 2D concept sketches to
        polished 3D visualizations. Nothing fancy: just Autodesk Sketchbook, a
        tablet, and way too many late nights.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve always had a passion for Cars and Motorsports. Even though I work
        as a software engineer, designing cars has always been my core
        personality trait. I'm currently building my portfolio piece by piece —
        experimenting, breaking things, fixing them, learning tools, and pushing
        myself into serious automotive design territory.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal? Simple — build cool cars for the world, not just admire them.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m all grit, curiosity, and creative chaos… but in a disciplined way.
        If you’re into futuristic forms, experimental silhouettes, and someone
        who refuses to settle for "average".
